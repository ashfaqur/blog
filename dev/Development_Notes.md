# Blog Project

Make a CRUD blog project.

## Idea

The idea is to use Spring Boot framework for the CRUD,
a python script for testing the REST APIs,
and docker for deployment.

Extended goals:
- PostgreSQL for database
- Angular frontend to access CRUD and manual testing


## Spring Boot setup

The first is the initial project setup with Spring Boot.

## Maven Commands

     ./mvnw package

      java -jar target/blog-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 

## Spring Security

Exclude the main endpoint from the secuirty login
